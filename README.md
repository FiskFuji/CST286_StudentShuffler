Title:        CST 286 Student Shuffler

Objective:    Print out a seating arrangement for CST 286 (Fall 2016), in which 
                students are shuffled randomly between CS++ and CSin3 cohorts, with 
                an alternating pattern. I.E: CS++, CSin3, CS++, CSin3, etc.

Objective 2:  To construct the code in a way, such that at the end of CST 286
                students should be able to understand it themselves.

#===============================================================================

This is a semi-modular student shuffler. Students can be added to one of the two lists,
CSPP or CSI3. The program will then shuffle the lists randomly, and then arrange them so
that the students alternate from both lists. (List 2, List 1, List 2, etc.)

This program was developed to encourage our two cohort programs (groups of students who
take the same pathway of clases, and stay with each other through college and create a
learning community) to intermingle during CST 286: Physics of Computing.
